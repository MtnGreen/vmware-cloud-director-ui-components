Those results are gropued\n * in sections based on the registered provider {@link SpotlightSearchProvider}.\n *\n * You can provide order of the search providers, hence the order of the displayed sections\n *\n * If there is just one search provider no section title is displayed.\n *\n * In case of multiple search providers the Spotlight Search can be configured to hide the entire section if it contains no data.\n *\n *\n * For a complete end-to-end running example please take a look at the `Examples` tab of the live-docs\n */\n@Component({\n    selector: 'vcd-spotlight-search',\n    templateUrl: './spotlight-search.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['./spotlight-search.component.scss'],\n})\nexport class SpotlightSearchComponent {\n    /**\n     * Placeholder for the search input.

Before you start working with vcd-ui-common, please\nread our Developer Certificate of Origin. All contributions to this repository must be\nsigned as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on\nas an open-source patch.\nContribution Flow\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\nCreate a topic branch from where you want to base your work\nMake commits of logical units\nMake sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below)\nPush your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository\nSubmit a pull request\n\nContribution Requirements\n\nPublic/exported members must be documented using tsdoc\n\nEvery commit must contain unit tests, striving for full coverage. If full coverage cannot be achieved, the Pull\nRequest should explain why tests could not be written.\n\nDescriptive Pull Requests:\n\nInclude list of steps for manual testing\nExplain alternatives that were considered\nFor bug fixes, explain what was causing the issue, don't repeat the text from the issue\n\n\n\nMerge vs fast-forward\nPRs with single commits should use --fast-forward. Otherwise, pull requests should be merge commits.\nStaying In Sync With Upstream\nWhen your branch gets out of sync with the vmware/master branch, use the following to update:\ngit checkout my-new-feature\ngit fetch -a\ngit pull --rebase upstream master\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureUpdating pull requests\nIf your PR fails to pass CI or needs changes based on code review, you'll most likely want to squash these changes into\nexisting commits.\nIf your pull request contains a single commit or your changes are related to the most recent commit, you can simply\namend the commit.\ngit add .\ngit commit --amend\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureIf you need to squash changes into an earlier commit, you can use:\ngit add .\ngit commit --fixup \ngit rebase -i --autosquash master\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureBe sure to add a comment to the PR indicating your new changes are ready to review, as GitHub does not generate a\nnotification when you git push.\nCode Style\nFormatting Commit Messages\nWe follow the conventions on How to Write a Git Commit Message.\nBe sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See\nGFM syntax for referencing issues\nand commits.\nReporting Bugs and Creating Issues\nWhen opening a new issue, try to roughly follow the commit message format conventions

Used for creating\ncomponent renderer specification of ColumnRendererSpec type\nExample usage:\nconst gridColumn = {\n   renderer: ColumnComponentRendererSpec({type: BoldTextRendererComponent, config: record => ({text: ''})\n}\nIn the above example this method helps in making sure that:\n\nValue \"v\" returned by the config function is of BoldTextRendererConfig type for gridColumn.renderer\n\n#Note: 'C & {}' below makes the inference site for C be the constructor type from the first

components for vcd-ui and its plugin developers. See its README\nfor further details\nInternalization Library (./projects/i18n) @vcd/i18n\nTranslation code for vcd-ui and its plugin developers. See its README\nfor further details\nExamples App (./projects/examples)\nThe application that showcases @vcd/ui-components using @vmw/ng-live-docs.\nRun npm start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if\nyou change any of the source files. This is where you'll see changes made in components\nRoute Analyzer (./projects/route-analyzer) @vcd/route-analyzer\nRoute Analyzer statically analyzes angular source code and generates a json file with all the available routes,\nincluding the ones from lazy loaded modules. See its README\nfor further details\nPeer Dependencies\nThe component library depends on Clarity and Angular\nwhich must must be installed from your application's package.json. See package.json for version\ninformation.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use\nng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun npm run build:components, or npm run build:i18n. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun npm run test:components, or npm run test:i18n to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests (Examples App)\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nCloning the repo\nWe typically use git clone https://github.com/vmware/vmware-cloud-director-ui-components ./vcd-ui-common to avoid\nthe extremely long folder name.\nPublishing\nPublishing happens through the CI/CD pipeline. See package.json\nVersioning\nFor all official releases, versioning should be semantic as per NPM's documentation.\nFor all development, nightly builds, the version should be created using npm version prerelease --preid=dev.\nSteps for publishing an @next release:\n\nUpdate version number in projects//package.json\nPush the changes to a remote topic branch and create a pull request into vmware/vmware-cloud-director-ui-components/master\nUpon approval of the PR, merge that PR into master\n\nFollowing the above steps makes the CI-CD pipeline to execute publishing job to npm with @next tag(npm publish --tag next)\nSteps for publishing an @latest release:\n\nUpdate version number in projects//package.json\nPush the changes to a remote topic branch and create a pull request into vmware/vmware-cloud-director-ui-components/master\nUpon approval of the PR, Push the changes to remote repo using Git tag using following commands:\nAdd a Git tag to the HEAD commit that has to be published as latest: git tag -fa -v[0-999].[0-999].[0-999]\nPush to the remote repo(vmware/vmware-cloud-director-ui-components): git push git@github.com:vmware/vmware-cloud-director-ui-components.git refs/tags/-v[0-999].[0-999].[0-999]\n\n\n\nFollowing the above steps makes the CI-CD pipeline to execute publishing job to npm with @latest tag(npm publish)\nAngular CLI\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.3.20. We attempt to\nkeep the project following CLI guidelines so we can benefit from ng update.\nFurther help\nTo get further help, please file issues on github.\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the\nAngular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No
